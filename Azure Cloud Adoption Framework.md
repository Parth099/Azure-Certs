> High  level notes

Five Pillers:
1. Reliablity
2. Security
3. Cost Optimization
4. Operation Excellence
5. Performance Efficiency

There is a tool on azure to see how well your workload fits this framework.

## Pillars

### Reliablity

> Design for failure

Application must be able to detect, withstand and recover from failure. It also needs to be highly observable. 

### Security

Calls to use the Zero-trust model, the encryption of data at all times, and applying bounds to your systemso the software cannot be used for incorrect things[^1].

_Note_: Azure reccomends zole-based security.

### Cost Optimization

### Operation Excellence

### Performance Efficiency


[^1]: For example (networking) you should block the exflitration of data.
