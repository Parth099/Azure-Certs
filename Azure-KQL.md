# KQL (Kusto QL)

 + read-only QL

Each query begins with a Data source. Then data is processed (condition passing, ordering, ...).

In the image below `StormEvents` is the data source.

in KQL you can predefine vars to use in the query; there also exist many pre-built functions to aid in query development. You are free to also create functions.
