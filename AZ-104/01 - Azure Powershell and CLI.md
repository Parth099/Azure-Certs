# Azure Powershell and CLI

**Important Note:** Commands on the Azure CLI and Azure PS are not simply ported over. You can do a lot more on the PS side and the command behavior is different.

See [ms.learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

Basic RG example: [cli-docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-cli)

One option is to run the PS/CLI commands on Azure Cloud Shell. This allows you to run commands without having to install anything.
