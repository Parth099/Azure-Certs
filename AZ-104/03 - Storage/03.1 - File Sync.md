# File Sync

Most companies have each employee be given their **own** fileshare which are hosted on on-prem hardware. The Azure File Sync service is then used to store a copy of the file shares due to its HA and durable nature.

The [File Sync Agent](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57159) is what enables the machines to connect and sync files onto the share. It will register your machines as file servers when fully set up.

When creating a File Share a Sync Group has to be created. This Sync Group is responsible for the syncing between devices and is used to manage which machines are using the same file sync. 

When two machines are using the same group files created, updated and deleted will be reflected on both as long as the sync agent is running. **Note**, if files are changed via the portal file share explorer the change will not be reflected on the machines using the file sync.
