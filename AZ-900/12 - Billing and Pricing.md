## Pricing and Support - SLAs

SLAs are customized to each Azure Service. Under Azure, uptime and connectivity are described as **performance targets** which is represented by a percentage.

### Service Credit

When a SLA is not met by Azure, service credit is applied to the bill to compensate for under-performing Azure resources. 

### Composite SLA

A composite SLA is when you combine SLAs across different service offering. To get this you multiply all **performance targets** with the services involved.
