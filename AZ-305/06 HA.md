# High Availability

-   Application Redundency
-   Avoid Single Point of Failure
-   Auto Scaling
-   DDoS Protection
-   Split VMs Availability Sets & Zones

Obtaining HA often requires

-   Multiple Servers
-   More then one AZ
-   LBs
-   Data Replication
-   Highly Available Messaging/Queues and Storage

Not all components require HA consideration. Some components that are non-essential do not require HA planning like backend jobs that allow some downtime (e.g Batch Jobs or Admin Apps).

Note: Some services are not tied down to a region and are known as _always-available_ services. Examples include:

1. Entra ID
2. DNS
3. CDN
4. Policy
5. ... many more

## Storage HA

> Azure Storage is already highly durable. Azure **WILL NOT** lose your file as even by default it is locally redundant.

Considerations

-   Latency caused by distance on secondary regions
-   Using SA for backing up other resources (Ex: VMs)
